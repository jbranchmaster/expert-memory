# Debt definitions


  > Debt, not poverty, is the greatest enemy of financial well-being and peace of mind.

  > â€¦debt defines your future, and when your future is defined, hope begins to die. You have committed your life to making money to pay for your past. Stay away from debt if you can. There is no sadder sight than the person with dreams and promise whose eyes have dulled and whose days are spent pushing the heavy wheel of debt toward an endless horizon.
