# Zone 2 Exercise

- Exercising at this Zone builds an aerobic base.
- Plays a crucial role in preventing chronic disease by improving the health, efficiency, and flexibility of your mitochondriaâ€”which decline with age.
- Zone 2 is defined as the highest metabolic output/work that you can sustain while keeping your lactate level below two millimole per liter.
- Zone 2 is at 65 to 75 percent of your max heart rate, so it's a low-intensity, basic endurance pace without intervals
- For a beginner: ~2 hours a week is a good place to start. e.g a weekend long-slow distance work or 2 * 45-60 mins sessions in a week.
- For an expert: ~3-4 hours a week to maintainnthe fitness.
